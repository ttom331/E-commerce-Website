# E-commerce Website

The requirement of this project is to create a web application for an ecommerce website. This ecommerce site will need to sell different types of stationery and books. The web application will require customers to register for an account and sign in to make purchases. Customers will need to be able to view the different products from a database and view them in different categories, a search tool should be available to the users to search for specific products. When customers purchase products, they should be able to select different delivery options for where they want to deliver across the world. These different delivery options should have additional fees depended on the location (for example, Â£15 delivery fee if you deliver outside of Europe). Additionally, discounts should also be implemented for customers on their orders.

This website was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and Bootstrap 5.0. MySQL used for the database.
